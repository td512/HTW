This... won't be easy. Let's get you briefed on what's happened so far.

About 20 years ago we discovered by way of Satoshi Nakamoto how to create an effectively decentralized network.

We call this the blockchain. In its first few years of life, only about 7 'altcoins' were created.

By 2020, that number had increased to hundreds, and now? Now it's a mess. The networks implemented concepts like

Proof of Stake, in an effort to reduce energy consumption across the chain as a whole, but people just moved to a

different altcoin, exasperating the problem. Back then mining used close on 100 Terawatt Hours per year, or about

0.5% of all demand, but as the blockchains improved, in an effort to slow down global warming, miners were increasingly

moving to altcoins where things like Proof of Stake don't exist. We saw it with ETH and DOGE at the start, and

there was nothing we could do.

...

Well, until now. Currently mining consumes about 25% of all global demand, or about 10,000 Terawatt Hours per year.

I control 39% of the pool, and with advances in technology, the miner pool self heals, and learns. Scary stuff.

But that creates an opportunity, with PortHack.Heart, to seize control and shut down the pool once and for all, and

we're going to do that together. Let's get going, there's only so much time left.

...

If you're reading this, I'm already dead, but my scripts are still working.

It's time to end this once and for all. I'll try my best to make this as easy for you as possible,

Let's shut down the network. This might take a moment.
